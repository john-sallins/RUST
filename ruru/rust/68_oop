// OBJECTS CONTAIN DATA AND BEHAVIOUR THAT FUNCTIONS ON THAT DATA 

// STRUCTS AND ENUMS ORGANIZE AND CONTAIN DATA.

// IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKS CONTAIN METHODS ON STRUCTS AND ENUMS.

// ENCAPSULATION IS A FEATURE OF OOP THROUGH WHICH WE HIDE THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS.

// ENCAPSULATION: THE IMPLEMENTATION DEATILS OF AN OBJECT ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THAT CODE.

// Therefore, the only way to interact with an object is through its public API;

// by default every object in rust is private.

// INHERITENCE: Inheritance is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from another object’s definition, 
// thus gaining the parent object’s data and behavior without you having to define them again.
// RUST DOES NOT USE INHERITENCE
