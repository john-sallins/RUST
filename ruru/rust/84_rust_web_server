//1.  Listen to the tcp connection 
// 1. Listening to the TCP connection
//1.1. So firstly, our web server needs to listen to the TCP connection. 
// 1.2. The 'std::net' module allows us to do this. 
// 1.3. The 'std::net::TcpListener;' will enable you listen to tcp connections.
// 1.4. In networking connecting to a port to listen is known as binding. 
// 1.5. So basically, when you enter the above ip address, the bind function will listen to it.
// 1.6. The bind function also works as a new function which means that will it will also simultaneously return a NEW instance of the TCP listener.
// 1.7. The bind function can only work on ports higher than 1023 due to administrator permissions. 
// 1.7.1. Anything lower than 1023 and the bind function won't work. 




//2. Reading the data 
// 2.1. Now, let's write a new funtion to read the request from the browser.
// 2.2. Weâ€™ll read data from the TCP stream and print it so we can see the data being sent from the browser.
// 2.3.  HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:

Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body

// 2.4.
