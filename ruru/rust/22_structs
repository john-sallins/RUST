// Structs can hold multiple values.
// In a struct, you have to name each piece of the data so we know what the values mean.
// You don't have to rely on the order of the data.


// Step 1: To define a struct, we first enter the keyword struct
// Step 2: We name the struct
// Step 3: Inside the struct, we define the names and the pieces of data.

{
    //Name: type
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,

}

// Step 4: To use a struct
